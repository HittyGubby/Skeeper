### Skeeper

A sleep reminder. ULTRA SIMPLIFIED.

Basically, you set your waking time and if you start sleeping right now, use the awake time divided by sleep time to get the work-sleep ratio, then compare it to the recommended 8 hours of sleep per day to see how much your sleep is lacking. Smaller the percentage, more the sleep.

So pretty much another useless project by HittyGubby the GubbyTheHitter.(Hitler?)

Not gonna lock your phone or do random insidious tricks, just to let you feel pressure and time will let you adjust your sleep.
